# Darts

Darts is a small front-end app written in Angular7 which keep tracks of your score in a darts game. 
Two views are available for input the score: 

1. one which use classic input boxes.
2. one which display a classic darts board on which you can select the points scored for each shoot.

A _history_ tab is available which displays the points scored for each move by each player.

Another tab show the current ranking.

Currently, only one type of game is available: starting from 301 points to zero.

Darts is optimized for mobile and tablets only. There is no reason to keep track of a game with your laptop !!

In production, there is no need of database because nothing is stored and there is no authentication either.

A live demo can be found here: http://friends-darts.herokuapp.com

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
